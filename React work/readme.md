# React Projects.

<h2> How to view the projects </h2>

<p> Each parent folder contains an src folder <p>

<p> For the first three parent folders, you can simply use create-react-app,
and then replace your src folder with the src folder in these folders </p>

<p> For the fourth parent folder : </p>

<ol>
	<li>Use create-react-app and replace your src folder.</li>
	<li>Go to App.js , you need to import the individual file to view the result </li>
	<li>Go to the tutorial folder in the src folder, and then to the module you want to view, and then the setup folder.</li>
	<li>Find the js file yoou want to view.</li>
	<li>Add the following line on the App.js :
		<p>import Setup from *module_name*/setup/*js_file_name*</p>
		<p>Eg : import Setup from 1-useState/setup/1-error-example
	</li>
	<li> Use npm start to view the result, or go to the tutorial folder> setup folder > js file to find the code. </li>
	<li> This process can be done a bit more easily using the vscode terminal and the folder viewer. Sorry for the inconvenience </li>

	<li>Sorry for such a tedious process. </li>
</ol>
